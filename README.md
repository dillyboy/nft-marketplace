## Demo Project Features
✅ Vanilla React project \
✅ No third party utility/ UI libraries such as Bootstrap are used (only animate.css for simple animations) \
✅ Home route and detailed view route using React Router v6 \
✅ Redux Toolkit used for state management (Redux author's recommended way of using Redux) \
✅ Responsive Design which adapts well on mobile devices \
✅ Usage of SCSS along with SCSS Modules to avoid style leakages \
✅ Scalable folder structure \
✅ Reusable components such as the Products Grid, Input field and Carousel are kept separately \
✅ Images in Carousel are preloaded for better performance (specially since 3 images are always returned) \
✅ Subtle animations (not too flashy) are used for a smooth user experience (check when an invalid bid is entered)
